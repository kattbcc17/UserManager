# Overview

As a software developer student, I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn new programming languages. 
In this project, I aimed to demonstrate my understanding of the C++ language by creating a simple user management system. 
This system allows users to register, login, view the user list, search for users, and delete users. 
My goal was to apply C++ language syntax and concepts to build a functional and user-friendly application.

The software I wrote is a console-based user management system that utilizes C++'s object-oriented programming features, such as classes and objects, to manage user data. 
The system provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system and perform various actions.
{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE)
- The GCC compiler to compile and run my C++ code
- The C++ Standard Library for various utility functions and data structures
I wrote the software in C++ and utilized the following libraries:

- <iostream> for input/output operations
- <map> for storing user data in a map
- <string> for working with strings
- <vector> for storing user data in a vector (not used in this implementation, but could be useful in future extensions)

# Future Work

Here are some areas for improvement and future development:

- Implementing data encryption and secure password storage
- Adding more advanced user management features, such as user roles and permissions
- Improving the user interface to make it more user-friendly and interactive
- Expanding the system to support multiple user types, such as administrators and regular users
- Integrating the system with a database for persistent data storage
